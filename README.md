##What is the Cleveridge Subdomain Scanner ?
The Cleveridge Subdomain Scanner finds subdomains of a given domain and shows the list on screen and records all results in easy accessible log-files.

On the first run the tool creates a directory '/log' to store all results in.

##What are the requirements ?
This tool is tested in a Linux environment with Python 2.7 installed

##How does it work ?
In Linux, download the files in to the directory of your choice. BE sure the cl_subd_scan.py file is executeble (chmod 0766) and the other files are readable.
In Terminal go to directory your files are listed in and run the cl_subd_scan.py file followed by the domain name of the domain you want to search the subdomains of eg.
"""./cl_subd_scan.py google.com"""
