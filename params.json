BE sure the cl_subd_scan.py file is executeble (chmod 0766) and the other files are readable.\r\nIn Terminal go to directory your files are listed in and run the cl_subd_scan.py file followed by the domain name of the domain you want to search the subdomains of eg.  \r\n- Tries the full list of +114.000 subdomains   \r\n```./cl_subd_scan.py google.com   ```       \r\n- Tries the mini list of 2000 subdomains   \r\n```./cl_subd_scan.py -s subs_mini.txt google.com   ``` \r\n- Tries multiple domains with the mini list   \r\n```./cl_subd_scan.py -s subs_mini.txt google.com yahoo.com msn.com   ``` \r\n- Help   \r\n```./cl_subd_scan.py -h   ```    \r\n\r\n##Warning\r\nWhen you are using the full list of +114.000 subdomains, the scan takes a while. For slow domains or when you are working over a VPN it can take more then 1 hour for each domain.    \r\nThe 'subs_mini.txt'-list is much faster. This list contains the most common subdomains but of course the list is not as complete as the full 'subs.txt'-list. This means you can miss some, not so common, subdomains.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Contact Info \r\n**Cleveridge** - Ethical Hacking Lab   \r\nDe Brulen 28   \r\n2370 Arendonk   \r\nBelgium   \r\nhttps://cleveridge.org\r\n\r\n##Developer\r\n- **Erwin De Laat** [ redN00ws ]     \r\nhttps://twitter.com/erwindelaat    \r\n- Credits to TheRook for the initial files of Subbrute V1.0    \r\nhttps://github.com/TheRook/subbrute\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
